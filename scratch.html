        <h3> 1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.
</h3>
    </p> The Bat Catch is the easy game. I learned the concepts that I applied the motions and movements so I can control the bats to catch the butterflies
    <p>
        <br>
        <h3> 2. Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?
</h3>
    </p>I encountered on making levels and how to start the new level and make it harder, I had to search youtube for instructions so I could do make it better.
    <p>
        <br>
        <h3> 3. What aspects of your game do you like best?
</h3>
    </p> I like the movements of the bat the best, because it is easy to catch the butterflies with arrow keys
    <p>
        <br>
        <h3> 4. If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?
</h3>
    </p> If more time was given for me to work on my game, I would improve buggy movements and sounds to make it more effective
